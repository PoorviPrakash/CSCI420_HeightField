FUNCTIONALITIES EXECUTED:

Pressing '1' renders heightmap using POINTS.
Pressing '2' renders heightmap using LINES/WIREFRAME.
Pressing '3' renders heightmap using SOLID FILL.
Pressing '4' renders heightmap using Blue colored vertices.
Pressing '5' renders heightmap using Pink colored vertices.
Pressing 't' and dragging the image enables translation.
Dragging mouse while the left mouse button clickedproduces rotation about the x and y axes.
Dragging mouse with the middle mouse button clicked produces rotation about the z-axis.
Holding SHIFT and dragging the mouse with the left mouse button clicked produces scaling on the x and y axes.

EXTRA CREDIT ATTEMPTED:
Pressing '6' renders WIREFRAME on top of SOLID FILL. 
Rendering heightmap with the coloured input image (bpp = 3). You can input the colored image using command line arguments just like we did for the grayscale image.
Example - 
./assign1 <Coloured-Image-filename.jpg>

PLEASE NOTE:
1. The code is able to handle a 256x256 image
2. For Artistic consideration - I have rendered a heightmap for a grayscale flower and rendered it in a pink gradient color. Added simple animation to give the effect of the flower blooming. 
3. The output screenshots of the spiral, SantaMonicaMountains, OhioPyle, GrandTeton, flower and coloured line are under the "Output Screenshots" folder.
